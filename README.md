This project presents the development of a peer-to-peer (P2P) ticketing platform leveraging blockchain technology. The project aims to create a decentralized marketplace where users can create, buy, and trade event tickets securely and transparently, eliminating common issues such as fraud, scalping, and excessive fees.

# Overview:
The platform utilizes blockchain to ensure the authenticity and ownership of tickets, providing a secure environment for peer-to-peer transactions. By decentralizing the ticketing process, the system gives control back to users, allowing them to interact directly without the need for intermediaries. Smart contracts govern transactions, ensuring that tickets are only transferred upon payment and that all parties adhere to the agreed terms. 
**Key Features:**

- **Decentralized Marketplace:** Users can buy and sell tickets directly to one another without relying on a central authority, reducing costs and improving efficiency.
- **Blockchain-Backed Ticketing:** Tickets are issued as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain, ensuring that they are unique, traceable, and impossible to counterfeit.
- **Smart Contracts:** Transactions are automated through smart contracts, which handle payments and ticket transfers, ensuring that all parties fulfill their obligations.
- **Fraud Prevention:** The use of blockchain technology prevents ticket duplication and fraud, providing users with confidence in the authenticity of their purchases.
- **Dynamic Pricing and Resale Control:** Event organizers can implement rules for ticket resale, such as price caps, to prevent scalping and ensure fair access to tickets.

# Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop front-end for a decentralized platform that addresses the limitations of traditional ticketing systems, such as high fees, fraud, and lack of transparency. By enabling peer-to-peer transactions and leveraging blockchain technology, the platform seeks to create a fairer and more efficient ticketing ecosystem. The main focus of this project is in proving the user a friendly interface to navigate through various funtionalities of the app.

# Setup:
This App need to run on Android Studio using emulator with API 34 or 35. The emulator needs to have internet connection enabled. To perform the operations regarding buying, creating tickets or visualizing the transactions performed on the app,  *lora.algokit.io* can be used. Lora provides UI to see operations using localnet, this connection with localnet requires some additional applications to be installed that depends the OS. As this app was developed on MacOS, it needed Homebrew and Docker as pre-requirement to connect with localnet. Both for mac and windows git, docker, python, pipx, Visual Studio Code is necessary. When the algokit environment is all set up the connection be made using *algokit localnet start* command from the VScode terminal. Once the connection is established the app can be run directly from VS-code terminal using *npm start*. If it shows any error regarding network request failed, its because the connection with localnet was not established correctly. 

# Workflow:
The mobile app is built using React-Native and JavaScript. As react-native does not support an actual wallet intergration in a mobile app, AsyncStorage was used to resemble the wallet, required for saving private key that user needs to sign his transactions. *Algosdk* library served for creating user account and handling all the operations  whether its creating, buying ASA assets or making transaction payments. To see the results of various operations performed on the app, "Lora" from algokit was used, as it has a solid UI for working on localnet. Lora can be used to:
- Explore blocks, transactions, transaction groups, assets, accounts and applications on LocalNet, TestNet or MainNet.
- Monitor and inspect real-time transactions related to an asset, account, or application with the live transaction view.
- Review historical transactions related to an asset, account, or application through the historical transaction view.
  
App interface allows the user to navigate through three main screens: Home, Create, Metrics. The Home-screen allows the user to explore and search for different tickets available in the market based on the selected event and other parameters. The user can see the details of these tickets and directly buy them. In Create Screen user can create new event or new ticket by filling the form. Metrics screen allows user to see his transaction history. It displays the details of transcations made and assets held my the account.
**Future works** The main focus of this project is to develop front-end to provide the UI for performing all the operations, the data input that user gets shown while creating or buying ticket or event is currently hardcoded as it requires backend integration.
